## Overview

In this project, you’ll learn to:
- Handle user input and output.
- Use conditionals (`if`, `else`) to check answers.
- Add scoring systems to track progress.
- Use loops and lists for dynamic quizzes.
- Save scores and create a leaderboard.

---

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Install Python 3.x: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Use a text editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

### Files in the Project
- **`level-1.py`**: Basic single-question quiz.
- **`level-2.py`**: Multi-question quiz with scoring.
- **`level-3.py`**: Dynamic quiz with lists and file saving.
- **`level-4.py`**: Enhanced quiz with leaderboard functionality.

## Project Levels

### Level 1
- **Goal**: Write a Python script to ask a single question and check the answer.
- **File**: `level-1.py`
- **Output Example**:
    ```
    Welcome to the Quiz!
    Question 1: What is the capital of France?
    Your answer: Paris
    Correct!
    ```

---

### Level 2
- **Goal**: Expand the quiz with multiple questions and a scoring system.
- **File**: `level-2.py`
- **Features**:
    - Add more questions.
    - Display the final score.
- **Output Example**:
    ```
    Your final score is 2 out of 2.
    ```

---

### Level 3
- **Goal**: Use lists and loops to make the quiz dynamic. Save scores to a file.
- **File**: `level-3.py`
- **Features**:
    - Store questions and answers in a list.
    - Save the player’s name and score to `leaderboard.txt`.

---

### Level 4
- **Goal**: Enhance the quiz with a leaderboard display.
- **File**: `level-4.py`
- **Features**:
    - Read scores from `leaderboard.txt`.
    - Sort and display the leaderboard.

## Tasks and Challenges

### Beginner Tasks
1. Complete `level-1.py`:
   - Add a second question.
   - Customize the welcome message.
2. Expand `level-2.py`:
   - Add more questions and track the score.

### Intermediate Challenges
1. Use lists and loops in `level-3.py`:
   - Add at least two more questions.
   - Customize the questions in the `quiz` list.
2. Save the player’s score to the leaderboard.

### Advanced Challenges
1. Enhance the leaderboard in `level-4.py`:
   - Display only the top 3 scores.
   - Handle invalid inputs or file errors.
2. Add a timer for each question.

## Next Steps

After completing this project:
- Try creating your own quiz with new topics!
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like `tkinter`.

---

## Example Leaderboard Format

Ensure your `leaderboard.txt` file is structured like this:
Alice: 5 Bob: 3 Charlie: 7
